# 1Up Keyboards Super 16

https://www.1upkeyboards.com/shop/keyboard-kits/macro-pads/super-16-macro-pad/

These are the QMK firmware and AHK files I have made for the Super 16, a 16 key macropad with per-key RGB backlighting from 1Up Keyboards.

The nummacrolock.json file is to see the layers in the [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/1upkeyboards/super16/LAYOUT_ortho_4x4)
