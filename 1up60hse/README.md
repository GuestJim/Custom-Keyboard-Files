These are files I believe are relevant for the work I did with the 1up60hse PCB and 60% ANSI 2-plate Carbon Fiber kit I was provided by 1Up Keyboards.
This includes QMK Configurator JSON files and the QMK keymaps that can be compiled to make flashable firmware.
These are the files that work for me, so while I am sharing them, I cannot guarantee there will not be some necessary adjustment for you.
